## Introduction

The Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a two-player game where one player takes the role of "X," and the other player takes the role of "O." The goal is to place your symbol in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. It's a fun and interactive way to learn and practice Java programming concepts.

## Features

- **Simple Text-Based Interface**: The game is played in the console, making it easy to understand and accessible for all users.

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend by taking turns to make moves.

- **Winning Logic**: The game checks for a win condition when a player makes a move.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents invalid moves and provides feedback to the players.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented in Java and uses standard input and output for player interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rameshwargithub/TicTacToe.git
   ```

2. Compile the Java code:

   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the game:

   ```bash
   java TicTacToe
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns making moves. Input your moves in the format "row column," where `row` and `column` are the coordinates of the cell where you want to place your symbol.

3. The game will display the current board after each move and announce the winner if there is one.
